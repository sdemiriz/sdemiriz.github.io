            <h1 class="section-title">Skills</h1>
            <p>At this stage in my career I have carried out tasks mostly on the computational side of bioinformatics, working with population genetics. In the future I am looking forward to engaging in roles where I can develop my skills on the science side as well. My aim is to be able to use computational tools be able to ask and answer important questions.</p>

                <ul>
                    <p>Developing scalable, tested and reproducible genomics and genotyping data pipelines</p>

                    <p>Scripting for automating data analysis, transformation and visualization tasks</p>
                    <p>Developing software using industry-standard practices: version control, unit testing and writing documentation</p>
                    <p>Working with common NGS data formats and industry-standard tools for processing these files types</p>
                    <p>Accessing, querying and putting together SQL relational databases for organized data storage</p>

            <p>The selection of tools depends on the task at hand. Often considered as unnecessary in data-science adjacent disciplines, testing and version control are key aspect of developing proper processes in a research environment: when you are at the edge of known understanding of a topic, the only scaffold keeping you up is being able to trust in the methods you used to get there, only possible through testing and versioning any code you write.</p>
