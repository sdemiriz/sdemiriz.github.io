# sdemiriz Website

This website features a website version of my resume with all the relevant sections.

Written in HTML, SCSS and some embedded Ruby code for easy updates via the `_config.yml` and the contents of the `_data/` directory (also YAML files).

SCSS was based on the default `Minima` theme, styled using the Nord colorscheme.
