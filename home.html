  <p>Hi there, nice to e-meet you!</p>
  <p>
    I am a passionate bioinformatics programmer, excited about applying my
    software development skills and background in human genomics to contribute
    to reproducible genomics research in order to advance our understanding of
    human health and disease.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having worked in population genomics by studying the unique genetic
    signatures in founder populations, I come equipped with the right skillset
    for helping answer important research questions through the application of
    good software development practices.

  <p>Looking forward to getting in touch!</p>
